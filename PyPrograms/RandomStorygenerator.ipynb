Upon learning that the keys to Altair's secret library vault lie in Constantinople, he travels to the center of the Ottoman Empire to find them. Along the way he's caught between two warring brothers as they fight for their father's throne as Sultan.

Upon learning that the keys to Altair's secret library vault lie in Constantinople, he travels to the center of the Ottoman Empire to find them.
