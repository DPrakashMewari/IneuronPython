    "# The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide \n",

    "# OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent and manipulate data and their associated behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# OOP allows developers to create classes that encapsulate data and functions, \n",
    "# which can be used to create instances of those classes, also known as objects.\n",
    "# This approach enables the developer to write reusable code that can be used to solve complex problems,\n",
    "# and to design modular systems that can be easily expanded or modified."
